<p>Solana is the name of an open source project that is implementing a new,
high-performance, permissionless blockchain. Solana is also the name of a
company headquartered in San Francisco that maintains the open source project.</p>
<a class="header" href="#about-this-book" id="about-this-book"><h1>About this Book</h1></a>
<p>This book describes the Solana open source project, a blockchain built from the
ground up for scale. The book covers why it's useful, how to use it, how it
works, and why it will continue to work long after the company Solana closes
its doors. The goal of the Solana architecture is to demonstrate there exists a
set of software algorithms that when used in combination to implement a
blockchain, removes software as a performance bottleneck, allowing transaction
throughput to scale proportionally with network bandwidth. The architecture
goes on to satisfy all three desirable properties of a proper blockchain:
it is scalable, secure and decentralized.</p>
<p>The architecture describes a theoretical upper bound of 710 thousand
transactions per second (tps) on a standard gigabit network and 28.4 million
tps on 40 gigabit. Furthermore, the architecture supports safe, concurrent
execution of programs authored in general purpose programming languages such as
C or Rust.</p>

<a class="header" href="#history-of-the-solana-codebase" id="history-of-the-solana-codebase"><h1>History of the Solana Codebase</h1></a>
<p>In November of 2017, Anatoly Yakovenko published a whitepaper describing Proof
of History, a technique for keeping time between computers that do not trust
one another. From Anatoly's previous experience designing distributed systems
at Qualcomm, Mesosphere and Dropbox, he knew that a reliable clock makes
network synchronization very simple. When synchronization is simple the
resulting network can be blazing fast, bound only by network bandwidth.</p>
<p>Anatoly watched as blockchain systems without clocks, such as Bitcoin and
Ethereum, struggled to scale beyond 15 transactions per second worldwide when
centralized payment systems such as Visa required peaks of 65,000 tps. Without a
clock, it was clear they'd never graduate to being the global payment system or
global supercomputer most had dreamed them to be. When Anatoly solved the problem of
getting computers that don’t trust each other to agree on time, he knew he had
the key to bring 40 years of distributed systems research to the world of
blockchain. The resulting cluster wouldn't be just 10 times faster, or a 100
times, or a 1,000 times, but 10,000 times faster, right out of the gate!</p>
<p>Anatoly's implementation began in a private codebase and was implemented in the
C programming language. Greg Fitzgerald, who had previously worked with Anatoly
at semiconductor giant Qualcomm Incorporated, encouraged him to reimplement the
project in the Rust programming language. Greg had worked on the LLVM compiler
infrastructure, which underlies both the Clang C/C++ compiler as well as the
Rust compiler. Greg claimed that the language's safety guarantees would improve
software productivity and that its lack of a garbage collector would allow
programs to perform as well as those written in C.  Anatoly gave it a shot and
just two weeks later, had migrated his entire codebase to Rust. Sold.  With
plans to weave all the world's transactions together on a single, scalable
blockchain, Anatoly called the project Loom.</p>
<p>On February 13th of 2018, Greg began prototyping the first open source
implementation of Anatoly's whitepaper. The project was published to GitHub
under the name Silk in the loomprotocol organization. On February 28th, Greg
made his first release, demonstrating 10 thousand signed transactions could be
verified and processed in just over half a second. Shortly after, another
former Qualcomm cohort, Stephen Akridge, demonstrated throughput could be
massively improved by offloading signature verification to graphics processors.
Anatoly recruited Greg, Stephen and three others to co-found a company, then
called Loom.</p>
<p>Around the same time, Ethereum-based project Loom Network sprung up and many
people were confused about whether they were the same project. The Loom team decided it
would rebrand. They chose the name Solana, a nod to a small beach town North of
San Diego called Solana Beach, where Anatoly, Greg and Stephen lived and surfed
for three years when they worked for Qualcomm. On March 28th, the team created
the Solana Labs GitHub organization and renamed Greg's prototype Silk to
Solana.</p>
<p>In June of 2018, the team scaled up the technology to run on cloud-based
networks and on July 19th, published a 50-node, permissioned, public testnet
consistently supporting bursts of 250,000 transactions per second. In a later release in
December, called v0.10 Pillbox, the team published a permissioned testnet
running 150 nodes on a gigabit network and demonstrated soak tests processing
an <em>average</em> of 200 thousand transactions per second with bursts over 500
thousand. The project was also extended to support on-chain programs written in
the C programming language and run concurrently in a safe execution environment
called BPF.</p>
<a class="header" href="#what-is-a-solana-cluster" id="what-is-a-solana-cluster"><h1>What is a Solana Cluster?</h1></a>
<p>A cluster is a set of computers that work together and can be viewed from the
outside as a single system. A Solana cluster is a set of independently owned
computers working together (and sometimes against each other) to verify the
output of untrusted, user-submitted programs. A Solana cluster can be utilized
any time a user wants to preserve an immutable record of events in time or
programmatic interpretations of those events. One use is to track which of the
computers did meaningful work to keep the cluster running. Another use might be
to track the possession of real-world assets. In each case, the cluster
produces a record of events called the ledger. It will be preserved for the
lifetime of the cluster. As long as someone somewhere in the world maintains a
copy of the ledger, the output of its programs (which may contain a record of
who possesses what) will forever be reproducible, independent of the
organization that launched it.</p>
<a class="header" href="#what-are-sols" id="what-are-sols"><h1>What are Sols?</h1></a>
<p>A sol is the name of Solana's native token, which can be passed to nodes in a
Solana cluster in exchange for running an on-chain program or validating its
output. The Solana protocol defines that only 1 billion sols will ever exist,
but that the system may perform micropayments of fractional sols, and that a sol
may be split as many as 34 times. The fractional sol is called a <em>lamport</em>. It
is named in honor of Solana's biggest technical influence, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Lamport">Leslie
Lamport</a>. A lamport has a value
of approximately 0.0000000000582 sol (2^-34).</p>

<p>The Solana git repository contains all the scripts you might need to spin up your
own local testnet. Depending on what you're looking to achieve, you may want to
run a different variation, as the full-fledged, performance-enhanced
multinode testnet is considerably more complex to set up than a Rust-only,
singlenode testnode.  If you are looking to develop high-level features, such
as experimenting with smart contracts, save yourself some setup headaches and
stick to the Rust-only singlenode demo.  If you're doing performance optimization
of the transaction pipeline, consider the enhanced singlenode demo. If you're
doing consensus work, you'll need at least a Rust-only multinode demo. If you want
to reproduce our TPS metrics, run the enhanced multinode demo.</p>
<p>For all four variations, you'd need the latest Rust toolchain and the Solana
source code:</p>
<p>First, install Rust's package manager Cargo.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
$ source $HOME/.cargo/env
</code></pre>
<p>Now checkout the code from github:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ git clone https://github.com/solana-labs/solana.git
$ cd solana
</code></pre>
<p>The demo code is sometimes broken between releases as we add new low-level
features, so if this is your first time running the demo, you'll improve
your odds of success if you check out the
<a href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/releases">latest release</a>
before proceeding:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ TAG=$(git describe --tags $(git rev-list --tags --max-count=1))
$ git checkout $TAG
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="#configuration-setup" id="configuration-setup"><h3>Configuration Setup</h3></a>
<p>The network is initialized with a genesis ledger and fullnode configuration files.
These files can be generated by running the following script.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ ./multinode-demo/setup.sh
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="#drone-1" id="drone-1"><h3>Drone</h3></a>
<p>In order for the fullnodes and clients to work, we'll need to
spin up a drone to give out some test tokens.  The drone delivers Milton
Friedman-style &quot;air drops&quot; (free tokens to requesting clients) to be used in
test transactions.</p>
<p>Start the drone with:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ ./multinode-demo/drone.sh
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="#singlenode-testnet" id="singlenode-testnet"><h3>Singlenode Testnet</h3></a>
<p>Before you start a fullnode, make sure you know the IP address of the machine you
want to be the bootstrap leader for the demo, and make sure that udp ports 8000-10000 are
open on all the machines you want to test with.</p>
<p>Now start the bootstrap leader in a separate shell:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ ./multinode-demo/bootstrap-leader.sh
</code></pre>
<p>Wait a few seconds for the server to initialize. It will print &quot;leader ready...&quot; when it's ready to
receive transactions. The leader will request some tokens from the drone if it doesn't have any.
The drone does not need to be running for subsequent leader starts.</p>
<a class="header" href="#multinode-testnet" id="multinode-testnet"><h3>Multinode Testnet</h3></a>
<p>To run a multinode testnet, after starting a leader node, spin up some
additional full nodes in separate shells:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ ./multinode-demo/fullnode-x.sh
</code></pre>
<p>To run a performance-enhanced full node on Linux,
<a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads">CUDA 10.0</a> must be installed on
your system:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ ./fetch-perf-libs.sh
$ SOLANA_CUDA=1 ./multinode-demo/bootstrap-leader.sh
$ SOLANA_CUDA=1 ./multinode-demo/fullnode-x.sh
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="#testnet-client-demo" id="testnet-client-demo"><h3>Testnet Client Demo</h3></a>
<p>Now that your singlenode or multinode testnet is up and running let's send it
some transactions!</p>
<p>In a separate shell start the client:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ ./multinode-demo/client.sh # runs against localhost by default
</code></pre>
<p>What just happened? The client demo spins up several threads to send 500,000 transactions
to the testnet as quickly as it can. The client then pings the testnet periodically to see
how many transactions it processed in that time. Take note that the demo intentionally
floods the network with UDP packets, such that the network will almost certainly drop a
bunch of them. This ensures the testnet has an opportunity to reach 710k TPS. The client
demo completes after it has convinced itself the testnet won't process any additional
transactions. You should see several TPS measurements printed to the screen. In the
multinode variation, you'll see TPS measurements for each validator node as well.</p>
<a class="header" href="#testnet-debugging" id="testnet-debugging"><h3>Testnet Debugging</h3></a>
<p>There are some useful debug messages in the code, you can enable them on a per-module and per-level
basis.  Before running a leader or validator set the normal RUST_LOG environment variable.</p>
<p>For example</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To enable <code>info</code> everywhere and <code>debug</code> only in the solana::banking_stage module:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ export RUST_LOG=solana=info,solana::banking_stage=debug
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>To enable BPF program logging:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ export RUST_LOG=solana_bpf_loader=trace
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Generally we are using <code>debug</code> for infrequent debug messages, <code>trace</code> for potentially frequent
messages and <code>info</code> for performance-related logging.</p>
<p>You can also attach to a running process with GDB.  The leader's process is named
<em>solana-fullnode</em>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ sudo gdb
attach &lt;PID&gt;
set logging on
thread apply all bt
</code></pre>
<p>This will dump all the threads stack traces into gdb.txt</p>
<a class="header" href="#public-testnet" id="public-testnet"><h2>Public Testnet</h2></a>
<p>In this example the client connects to our public testnet. To run validators on the testnet you would need to open udp ports <code>8000-10000</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ ./multinode-demo/client.sh --network $(dig +short testnet.solana.com):8001 --duration 60
</code></pre>
<p>You can observe the effects of your client's transactions on our <a href="https://metrics.solana.com:3000/d/testnet/testnet-hud?orgId=2&amp;from=now-30m&amp;to=now&amp;refresh=5s&amp;var-testnet=testnet">dashboard</a></p>
<a class="header" href="#linux-snap" id="linux-snap"><h2>Linux Snap</h2></a>
<p>A Linux <a href="https://snapcraft.io/">Snap</a> is available, which can be used to easily

<a class="header" href="#programming-model" id="programming-model"><h1>Programming Model</h1></a>
<p>A client <em>app</em> interacts with a Solana cluster by sending it <em>transactions</em>
with one or more <em>instructions</em>. The Solana <em>runtime</em> passes those instructions
to user-contributed <em>programs</em>. An instruction might, for example, tell a
program to move <em>tokens</em> from one <em>account</em> to another or create an interactive
contract that governs how tokens are moved. Instructions are executed
atomically. If any instruction is invalid, any changes made within the
transaction are discarded.</p>
<a class="header" href="#deploying-programs-to-a-cluster" id="deploying-programs-to-a-cluster"><h2>Deploying Programs to a Cluster</h2></a>
<p><img alt="SDK tools" src="img/sdk-tools.svg" class="center"/></p>
<p>As shown in the diagram above a client creates a program and compiles it to an
ELF shared object containing BPF bytecode and sends it to the Solana cluster.
The cluster stores the program locally and makes it available to clients via a
<em>program ID</em>. The program ID is a <em>public key</em> generated by the client and is
used to reference the program in subsequent transactions.</p>
<p>A program may be written in any programming language that can target the
Berkley Packet Filter (BPF) safe execution environment. The Solana SDK offers
the best support for C programs, which is compiled to BPF using the <a href="https://llvm.org">LLVM
compiler infrastructure</a>. Alternatively, a client might
choose to bypass LLVM and use Python, Lua or C++ to generate BPF directly via
the <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc">BPF Compiler Collection</a> (BCC).</p>
<a class="header" href="#storing-state-between-transactions" id="storing-state-between-transactions"><h2>Storing State between Transactions</h2></a>
<p>If the program needs to store state between transactions, it does so using
<em>accounts</em>. Accounts are similar to files in operating systems such as Linux.
Like a file, an account may hold arbitrary data and that data persists beyond
the lifetime of a program. Also like a file, an account includes metadata that
tells the runtime who is allowed to access the data and how. Unlike a file, the
account includes metadata for the lifetime of the file. That lifetime is
expressed in &quot;tokens&quot;, which is a number of fractional native tokens, called
<em>lamports</em>. Accounts are held in validator memory and pay &quot;rent&quot; to stay there.
Each fullnode periodically scan all accounts and collects rent. Any account
that drops to zero lamports is purged.</p>
<p>If an account is marked &quot;executable&quot;, it will only be used by a <em>loader</em> to run
programs. For example, a BPF-compiled program is marked executable and loaded
by the BPF loader. No program is allowed to modify the contents of an
executable account.</p>
<p>An account also includes &quot;owner&quot; metadata. The owner is a program ID. The
runtime grants the program write access to the account if its ID matches the
owner. If an account is not owned by a program, the program is permitted to
read its data and credit the account.</p>
<p>In the same way that a Linux user uses a path to look up a file, a Solana
client uses public keys to look up accounts. To create an account, the client
generates a <em>keypair</em> and registers its public key using the CreateAccount
instruction. Once registered, transactions reference account keys to grant
programs access to accounts. The runtime grants programs read access by
default. To grant write access, the client must either assign the account to a
program or sign the transaction using the keypair's <em>secret key</em>. Since only
the holder of the secret key can produce valid signatures matching the
account's public key, the runtime recognizes the signature as authorization to
modify account data or debit the account.</p>
<p>After the runtime executes each of the transaction's instructions, it uses the
account metadata and transaction signatures to verify that none of the access
rules were violated. If a program violates an access rule, the runtime discards
all account changes made by all instructions and marks the transaction as
failed.</p>

<a class="header" href="#getting-tokens-to-users" id="getting-tokens-to-users"><h2>Getting tokens to users</h2></a>
<p>You may have noticed you interacted with the Solana cluster without first
needing to aquire tokens to pay transaction fees. Under the hood, the web
app creates a new ephemeral identity and sends a request to an off-chain
service for a signed transation authorizes a user to start a new game.
The service is called a <em>drone</em>. When the app sends the signed transaction
to the Solana cluster, the drone's tokens are spent to pay the transaction
fee and start the game. In a real world app, the drone might request the user
watch an ad or pass a CAPTCHA before signing over its tokens.</p>
<a class="header" href="#creating-signing-services-with-drones" id="creating-signing-services-with-drones"><h1>Creating Signing Services with Drones</h1></a>
<p>This chapter defines an off-chain service called a <em>drone</em>, which acts as
custodian of a user's private key. In its simplest form, it can be used to
create <em>airdrop</em> transactions, a token transfer from the drone's account to a
client's account.</p>
<a class="header" href="#signing-service" id="signing-service"><h2>Signing Service</h2></a>
<p>A drone is a simple signing service. It listens for requests to sign
<em>transaction data</em>.  Once received, the drone validates the request however it
sees fit. It may, for example, only accept transaction data with a
<code>SystemInstruction::Move</code> instruction transferring only up to a certain amount
of tokens. If the drone accepts the transaction, it returns an <code>Ok(Signature)</code>
where <code>Signature</code> is a signature of the transaction data using the drone's
private key. If it rejects the transaction data, it returns a <code>DroneError</code>
describing why.</p>
<a class="header" href="#examples" id="examples"><h2>Examples</h2></a>
<a class="header" href="#granting-access-to-an-on-chain-game" id="granting-access-to-an-on-chain-game"><h3>Granting access to an on-chain game</h3></a>
<p>Creator of on-chain game tic-tac-toe hosts a drone that responds to airdrop
requests containing an <code>InitGame</code> instruction. The drone signs the transaction
data in the request and returns it, thereby authorizing its account to pay the
transaction fee and as well as seeding the game's account with enough tokens to
play it. The user then creates a transaction for its transaction data and the
drones signature and submits it to the Solana cluster. Each time the user
interacts with the game, the game pays the user enough tokens to pay the next
transaction fee to advance the game. At that point, the user may choose to keep
the tokens instead of advancing the game. If the creator wants to defend
against that case, they could require the user to return to the drone to sign
each instruction.</p>
<a class="header" href="#worldwide-airdrop-of-a-new-token" id="worldwide-airdrop-of-a-new-token"><h3>Worldwide airdrop of a new token</h3></a>
<p>Creator of a new on-chain token (ERC-20 interface), may wish to do a worldwide
airdrop to distribute its tokens to millions of users over just a few seconds.
That drone cannot spend resources interacting with the Solana cluster. Instead,
the drone should only verify the client is unique and human, and then return
the signature. It may also want to listen to the Solana cluster for recent
entry IDs to support client retries and to ensure the airdrop is targeting the
desired cluster.</p>
<a class="header" href="#attack-vectors" id="attack-vectors"><h2>Attack vectors</h2></a>
<a class="header" href="#invalid-last_id" id="invalid-last_id"><h3>Invalid last_id</h3></a>
<p>The drone may prefer its airdrops only target a particular Solana cluster.  To
do that, it listens to the cluster for new entry IDs and ensure any requests
reference a recent one.</p>
<p>Note: to listen for new entry IDs assumes the drone is either a fullnode or a
<em>light</em> client. At the time of this writing, light clients have not been
implemented and no proposal describes them. This document assumes one of the
following approaches be taken:</p>
<ol>
<li>Define and implement a light client</li>
<li>Embed a fullnode</li>
<li>Query the jsonrpc API for the latest last id at a rate slightly faster than
ticks are produced.</li>
</ol>
<a class="header" href="#double-spends" id="double-spends"><h3>Double spends</h3></a>
<p>A client may request multiple airdrops before the first has been submitted to
the ledger. The client may do this maliciously or simply because it thinks the
first request was dropped. The drone should not simply query the cluster to
ensure the client has not already received an airdrop. Instead, it should use
<code>last_id</code> to ensure the previous request is expired before signing another.
Note that the Solana cluster will reject any transaction with a <code>last_id</code>
beyond a certain <em>age</em>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#denial-of-service" id="denial-of-service"><h3>Denial of Service</h3></a>
<p>If the transaction data size is smaller than the size of the returned signature
(or descriptive error), a single client can flood the network.  Considering
that a simple <code>Move</code> operation requires two public keys (each 32 bytes) and a
<code>fee</code> field, and that the returned signature is 64 bytes (and a byte to
indicate <code>Ok</code>), consideration for this attack may not be required.</p>
<p>In the current design, the drone accepts TCP connections. This allows clients
to DoS the service by simply opening lots of idle connections. Switching to UDP
may be preferred. The transaction data will be smaller than a UDP packet since
the transaction sent to the Solana cluster is already pinned to using UDP.</p>
<a class="header" href="#a-solana-cluster" id="a-solana-cluster"><h1>A Solana Cluster</h1></a>
<p>A Solana cluster is a set of fullnodes working together to serve client
transactions and maintain the integrity of the ledger. Many clusters may
coexist. When two clusters share a common genesis block, they attempt to
converge. Otherwise, they simply ignore the existence of the other.
Transactions sent to the wrong one are quietly rejected. In this chapter, we'll
discuss how a cluster is created, how nodes join the cluster, how they share
the ledger, how they ensure the ledger is replicated, and how they cope with
buggy and malicious nodes.</p>
<a class="header" href="#creating-a-cluster" id="creating-a-cluster"><h2>Creating a Cluster</h2></a>
<p>Before starting any fullnodes, one first needs to create a <em>genesis block</em>.
The block contains entries referencing two public keys, a <em>mint</em> and a
<em>bootstrap leader</em>. The fullnode holding the bootstrap leader's secret key is
responsible for appending the first entries to the ledger. It initializes its
internal state with the mint's account. That account will hold the number of
native tokens defined by the genesis block. The second fullnode then contacts
the bootstrap leader to register as a <em>validator</em> or <em>replicator</em>. Additional
fullnodes then register with any registered member of the cluster.</p>
<p>A validator receives all entries from the leader and submits votes confirming
those entries are valid. After voting, the validator is expected to store those
entries until replicator nodes submit proofs that they have stored copies of
it. Once the validator observes a sufficient number of copies exist, it deletes
its copy.</p>
<a class="header" href="#joining-a-cluster" id="joining-a-cluster"><h2>Joining a Cluster</h2></a>
<p>Fullnodes and replicators enter the cluster via registration messages sent to
its <em>control plane</em>. The control plane is implemented using a <em>gossip</em>
protocol, meaning that a node may register with any existing node, and expect
its registration to propagate to all nodes in the cluster. The time it takes
for all nodes to synchronize is proportional to the square of the number of
nodes participating in the cluster. Algorithmically, that's considered very
slow, but in exchange for that time, a node is assured that it eventually has
all the same information as every other node, and that that information cannot
be censored by any one node.</p>
<a class="header" href="#sending-transactions-to-a-cluster" id="sending-transactions-to-a-cluster"><h2>Sending Transactions to a Cluster</h2></a>
<p>Clients send transactions to any fullnode's Transaction Processing Unit (TPU)
port. If the node is in the validator role, it forwards the transaction to the
designated leader. If in the leader role, the node bundles incoming
transactions, timestamps them creating an <em>entry</em>, and pushes them onto the
cluster's <em>data plane</em>. Once on the data plane, the transactions are validated
by validator nodes and replicated by replicator nodes, effectively appending
them to the ledger.</p>
<a class="header" href="#confirming-transactions" id="confirming-transactions"><h2>Confirming Transactions</h2></a>
<p>A Solana cluster is capable of subsecond <em>confirmation</em> for up to 150 nodes
with plans to scale up to hundreds of thousands of nodes. Once fully
implemented, confirmation times are expected to increase only with the
logarithm of the number of validators, where the logarithm's base is very high.
If the base is one thousand, for example, it means that for the first thousand
nodes, confirmation will be the duration of three network hops plus the time it
takes the slowest validator of a supermajority to vote. For the next million
nodes, confirmation increases by only one network hop.</p>
<p>Solana defines confirmation as the duration of time from when the leader
timestamps a new entry to the moment when it recognizes a supermajority of
ledger votes.</p>
<p>A gossip network is much too slow to achieve subsecond confirmation once the
network grows beyond a certain size. The time it takes to send messages to all
nodes is proportional to the square of the number of nodes. If a blockchain
wants to achieve low confirmation and attempts to do it using a gossip network,
it will be forced to centralize to just a handful of nodes.</p>
<p>Scalable confirmation can be achieved using the follow combination of
techniques:</p>
<ol>
<li>Timestamp transactions with a VDF sample and sign the timestamp.</li>
<li>Split the transactions into batches, send each to separate nodes and have
each node share its batch with its peers.</li>
<li>Repeat the previous step recursively until all nodes have all batches.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solana rotates leaders at fixed intervals, called <em>slots</em>. Each leader may only
produce entries during its allotted slot. The leader therefore timestamps
transactions so that validators may lookup the public key of the designated
leader. The leader then signs the timestamp so that a validator may verify the
signature, proving the signer is owner of the designated leader's public key.</p>
<p>Next, transactions are broken into batches so that a node can send transactions
to multiple parties without making multiple copies. If, for example, the leader
needed to send 60 transactions to 6 nodes, it would break that collection of 60
into batches of 10 transactions and send one to each node. This allows the
leader to put 60 transactions on the wire, not 60 transactions for each node.
Each node then shares its batch with its peers. Once the node has collected all
6 batches, it reconstructs the original set of 60 transactions.</p>
<p>A batch of transactions can only be split so many times before it is so small
that header information becomes the primary consumer of network bandwidth. At
the time of this writing, the approach is scaling well up to about 150
validators. To scale up to hundreds of thousands of validators, each node can
apply the same technique as the leader node to another set of nodes of equal
size. We call the technique <em>data plane fanout</em>, but it is not yet implemented.</p>
<a class="header" href="#synchronization" id="synchronization"><h1>Synchronization</h1></a>
<p>Fast, reliable synchronization is the biggest reason Solana is able to achieve
such high throughput. Traditional blockchains synchronize on large chunks of
transactions called blocks. By synchronizing on blocks, a transaction cannot be
processed until a duration called &quot;block time&quot; has passed. In Proof of Work
consensus, these block times need to be very large (~10 minutes) to minimize
the odds of multiple fullnodes producing a new valid block at the same time.
There's no such constraint in Proof of Stake consensus, but without reliable
timestamps, a fullnode cannot determine the order of incoming blocks.  The
popular workaround is to tag each block with a <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_timestamp">wallclock
timestamp</a>. Because of clock drift
and variance in network latencies, the timestamp is only accurate within an
hour or two. To workaround the workaround, these systems lengthen block times
to provide reasonable certainty that the median timestamp on each block is
always increasing.</p>
<p>Solana takes a very different approach, which it calls <em>Proof of History</em> or
<em>PoH</em>. Leader nodes &quot;timestamp&quot; blocks with cryptographic proofs that some
duration of time has passed since the last proof. All data hashed into the
proof most certainly have occurred before the proof was generated. The node
then shares the new block with validator nodes, which are able to verify those
proofs. The blocks can arrive at validators in any order or even could be
replayed years later. With such reliable synchronization guarantees, Solana is
able to break blocks into smaller batches of transactions called <em>entries</em>.
Entries are streamed to validators in realtime, before any notion of block
consensus.</p>
<p>Solana technically never sends a <em>block</em>, but uses the term to describe the
sequence of entries that fullnodes vote on to achieve <em>confirmation</em>. In that
way, Solana's confirmation times can be compared apples to apples to
block-based systems. The current implementation sets block time to 800ms.</p>
<p>What's happening under the hood is that entries are streamed to validators as
quickly as a leader node can batch a set of valid transactions into an entry.
Validators process those entries long before it is time to vote on their
validity. By processing the transactions optimistically, there is effectively
no delay between the time the last entry is received and the time when the node
can vote. In the event consensus is <strong>not</strong> achieved, a node simply rolls back
its state. This optimisic processing technique was introduced in 1981 and
called <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.65.4735">Optimistic Concurrency
Control</a>.  It
can be applied to blockchain architecture where a cluster votes on a hash that
represents the full ledger up to some <em>block height</em>. In Solana, it is
implemented trivially using the last entry's PoH hash.</p>
<a class="header" href="#relationship-to-vdfs" id="relationship-to-vdfs"><h3>Relationship to VDFs</h3></a>
<p>The Proof of History technique was first described for use in blockchain by
Solana in November of 2017. In June of the following year, a similar technique
was described at Stanford and called a <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/601.pdf">verifiable delay
function</a> or <em>VDF</em>.</p>
<p>A desirable property of a VDF is that verification time is very fast. Solana's
approach to verifying its delay function is proportional to the time it took to
create it. Split over a 4000 core GPU, it is sufficiently fast for Solana's
needs, but if you asked the authors the paper cited above, they might tell you
(<a href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/issues/388">and have</a>) that Solana's
approach is algorithmically slow it shouldn't be called a VDF. We argue the
term VDF should represent the category of verifiable delay functions and not
just the subset with certain performance characteristics. Until that's
resolved, Solana will likely continue using the term PoH for its
application-specific VDF.</p>
<p>Another difference between PoH and VDFs is that a VDF is used only for tracking
duration. PoH's hash chain, on the other hand, includes hashes of any data the
application observed.  That data is a double-edged sword. On one side, the data
&quot;proves history&quot; - that the data most certainly existed before hashes after it.
On the side, it means the application can manipulate the hash chain by changing
<em>when</em> the data is hashed. The PoH chain therefore does not serve as a good
source of randomness whereas a VDF without that data could. Solana's <a href="#leader-rotation">leader
rotation algorithm</a>, for example, is derived only from the
VDF <em>height</em> and not its hash at that height.</p>
<a class="header" href="#relationship-to-consensus-mechanisms" id="relationship-to-consensus-mechanisms"><h3>Relationship to Consensus Mechanisms</h3></a>
<p>Proof of History is not a consensus mechanism, but it is used to improve the
performance of Solana's Proof of Stake consensus. It is also used to improve
the performance of the data plane and replication protocols.</p>

<a class="header" href="#leader-rotation" id="leader-rotation"><h1>Leader Rotation</h1></a>
<p>At any given moment, a cluster expects only one fullnode to produce ledger
entries. By having only one leader at a time, all validators are able to replay
identical copies of the ledger. The drawback of only one leader at a time,
however, is that a malicious leader is cabable of censoring votes and
transactions. Since censoring cannot be distinguished from the network dropping
packets, the cluster cannot simply elect a single node to hold the leader role
indefinitely. Instead, the cluster minimizes the influence of a malcioius
leader by rotating which node takes the lead.</p>
<p>Each validator selects the expected leader using the same algorithm, described
below. When the validator receives a new signed ledger entry, it can be certain
that entry was produced by the expected leader.</p>
<a class="header" href="#leader-schedule-generation" id="leader-schedule-generation"><h2>Leader Schedule Generation</h2></a>
<p>Leader schedule is generated using a predefined seed.  The process is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Periodically use the PoH tick height (a monotonically increasing counter) to
seed a stable pseudo-random algorithm.</li>
<li>At that height, sample the bank for all the staked accounts with leader
identities that have voted within a cluster-configured number of ticks. The
sample is called the <em>active set</em>.</li>
<li>Sort the active set by stake weight.</li>
<li>Use the random seed to select nodes weighted by stake to create a
stake-weighted ordering.</li>
<li>This ordering becomes valid after a cluster-configured number of ticks.</li>
</ol>
<p>The seed that is selected is predictable but unbiasable.  There is no grinding
attack to influence its outcome. The active set, however, can be biased by a
leader by censoring validator votes. To reduce the likelihood of censorship,
the active set is sampled many slots in advance, such that votes will have been
collected by multiple leaders. If even one node is honest, the malicious
leaders will not be able to use censorship to influence the leader schedule.</p>
<a class="header" href="#appending-entries" id="appending-entries"><h2>Appending Entries</h2></a>
<p>The lifetime of a leader schedule is called an <em>epoch</em>. The epoch is split into
<em>slots</em>, where each slot has a duration of <code>T</code> PoH ticks.</p>
<p>A leader transmits entries during its slot.  After <code>T</code> ticks, all the
validators switch to the next scheduled leader. Validators must ignore entries
sent outside a leader's assigned slot.</p>
<p>All <code>T</code> ticks must be observed by the next leader for it to build its own
entries on. If entries are not observed (leader is down) or entries are invalid
(leader is buggy or malicious), the next leader must produce ticks to fill the
previous leader's slot. Note that the next leader should do repair requests in
parallel, and postpone sending ticks until it is confident other validators
also failed to observe the previous leader's entries. If a leader incorrectly
builds on its own ticks, the leader following it must replace all its ticks.</p>
<a class="header" href="#fork-generation" id="fork-generation"><h1>Fork Generation</h1></a>

<a class="header" href="#overview" id="overview"><h2>Overview</h2></a>
<p>Nodes take turns being leader and generating the PoH that encodes state
changes.  The cluster can tolerate loss of connection to any leader by
synthesizing what the leader <strong><em>would</em></strong> have generated had it been connected
but not ingesting any state changes.  The possible number of forks is thereby
limited to a &quot;there/not-there&quot; skip list of forks that may arise on leader
rotation slot boundaries.  At any given slot, only a single leader's
transactions will be accepted.</p>
<a class="header" href="#message-flow" id="message-flow"><h2>Message Flow</h2></a>

</ol>
<a class="header" href="#partitions-forks" id="partitions-forks"><h2>Partitions, Forks</h2></a>
<p>Forks can arise at PoH tick counts that correspond to a vote.  The next leader
may not have observed the last vote slot and may start their slot with
generated virtual PoH entries.  These empty ticks are generated by all nodes in
the cluster at a cluster-configured rate for hashes/per/tick <code>Z</code>.</p>
<p>There are only two possible versions of the PoH during a voting slot: PoH with
<code>T</code> ticks and entries generated by the current leader, or PoH with just ticks.
The &quot;just ticks&quot; version of the PoH can be thought of as a virtual ledger, one
that all nodes in the cluster can derive from the last tick in the previous
slot.</p>
<p>Validators can ignore forks at other points (e.g. from the wrong leader), or
slash the leader responsible for the fork.</p>
<p>Validators vote based on a greedy choice to maximize their reward described in
<a href="fork-selection.html">forks selection</a>.</p>

<p><img alt="Fork generation" src="img/fork-generation.svg" class="center"/></p>
<p>Note that an <code>E</code> appearing on 2 forks at the same slot is a slashable
condition, so a validator observing <code>E3</code> and <code>E3'</code> can slash L3 and safely
choose <code>x</code> for that slot.  Once a validator commits to a forks, other forks can
be discarded below that tick count.  For any slot, validators need only
consider a single &quot;has entries&quot; chain or a &quot;ticks only&quot; chain to be proposed by
a leader.  But multiple virtual entries may overlap as they link back to the a
previous slot.</p>
<a class="header" href="#time-division" id="time-division"><h4>Time Division</h4></a>
<p>It's useful to consider leader rotation over PoH tick count as time division of
the job of encoding state for the cluster.  The following table presents the
above tree of forks as a time-divided ledger.</p>

<p>Note that only data from leader L3 will be accepted during leader slot L3.
Data from L3 may include &quot;catchup&quot; ticks back to a slot other than L2 if L3 did
not observe L2's data.  L4 and L5's transmissions include the &quot;ticks to prev&quot;
PoH entries.</p>
<p>This arrangement of the network data streams permits nodes to save exactly this
to the ledger for replay, restart, and checkpoints.</p>
<a class="header" href="#leaders-view" id="leaders-view"><h3>Leader's View</h3></a>
<p>When a new leader begins a slot, it must first transmit any PoH (ticks)

<a class="header" href="#pipelining" id="pipelining"><h2>Pipelining</h2></a>
<p>The fullnodes make extensive use of an optimization common in CPU design,
called <em>pipelining</em>.  Pipelining is the right tool for the job when there's a
stream of input data that needs to be processed by a sequence of steps, and
there's different hardware responsible for each. The quintessential example is
using a washer and dryer to wash/dry/fold several loads of laundry. Washing
must occur before drying and drying before folding, but each of the three
operations is performed by a separate unit. To maximize efficiency, one creates
a pipeline of <em>stages</em>. We'll call the washer one stage, the dryer another, and
the folding process a third. To run the pipeline, one adds a second load of
laundry to the washer just after the first load is added to the dryer.
Likewise, the third load is added to the washer after the second is in the
dryer and the first is being folded. In this way, one can make progress on
three loads of laundry simultaneously. Given infinite loads, the pipeline will
consistently complete a load at the rate of the slowest stage in the pipeline.</p>
<a class="header" href="#pipelining-in-the-fullnode" id="pipelining-in-the-fullnode"><h2>Pipelining in the Fullnode</h2></a>
<p>The fullnode contains two pipelined processes, one used in leader mode called
the TPU and one used in validator mode called the TVU. In both cases, the
hardware being pipelined is the same, the network input, the GPU cards, the CPU
cores, writes to disk, and the network output.  What it does with that hardware
is different.  The TPU exists to create ledger entries whereas the TVU exists
to validate them.</p>

<a class="header" href="#gossip-overview" id="gossip-overview"><h2>Gossip Overview</h2></a>
<p>Nodes continuously share signed data objects among themselves in order to
manage a cluster. For example, they share their contact information, ledger
height, and votes.</p>
<p>Every tenth of a second, each node sends a &quot;push&quot; message and/or a &quot;pull&quot;
message.  Push and pull messages may elicit responses, and push messages may be
forwarded on to others in the cluster.</p>
<p>Gossip runs on a well-known UDP/IP port or a port in a well-known range.  Once
a cluster is bootstrapped, nodes advertise to each other where to find their
gossip endpoint (a socket address).</p>
<a class="header" href="#gossip-records" id="gossip-records"><h2>Gossip Records</h2></a>
<p>Records shared over gossip are arbitrary, but signed and versioned (with a

<p>Upon receiving a push message, a node examines the message for:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Duplication: if the message has been seen before, the node responds with

<p>The runtime is a concurrent transaction processor. Transactions specify their

separating program code from the state it operates on, the runtime is able to
choreograph concurrent access. Transactions accessing only credit-only
accounts are executed in parallel whereas transactions accessing writable
accounts are serialized.  The runtime interacts with the program through an
entrypoint with a well-defined interface.  The userdata stored in an account is
an opaque type, an array of bytes. The program has full control over its
contents.</p>
<p>The transaction structure specifies a list of public keys and signatures for
those keys and a sequential list of instructions that will operate over the
states associated with the account keys.  For the transaction to be committed
all the instructions must execute successfully; if any abort the whole
transaction fails to commit.</p>

to store the full data set this protocol proposes a way for mining nodes to
provide storage capacity for pieces of the network.</p>
<p>The basic idea to Proof of Replication is encrypting a dataset with a public
symmetric key using CBC encryption, then hash the encrypted dataset. The main
problem with the naive approach is that a dishonest storage node can stream the
encryption and delete the data as its hashed. The simple solution is to force
the hash to be done on the reverse of the encryption, or perhaps with a random
order. This ensures that all the data is present during the generation of the
proof and it also requires the validator to have the entirety of the encrypted
data present for verification of every proof of every identity. So the space
required to validate is <code>number_of_proofs * data_size</code></p>

<a class="header" href="#optimization-with-poh" id="optimization-with-poh"><h2>Optimization with PoH</h2></a>
<p>Our improvement on this approach is to randomly sample the encrypted segments
faster than it takes to encrypt, and record the hash of those samples into the
PoH ledger. Thus the segments stay in the exact same order for every PoRep and
verification can stream the data and verify all the proofs in a single batch.
This way we can verify multiple proofs concurrently, each one on its own CUDA
core. The total space required for verification is <code>1_ledger_segment + 2_cbc_blocks * number_of_identities</code> with core count of equal to
<code>number_of_identities</code>. We use a 64-byte chacha CBC block size.</p>
<a class="header" href="#network" id="network"><h2>Network</h2></a>
<p>Validators for PoRep are the same validators that are verifying transactions.
They have some stake that they have put up as collateral that ensures that
their work is honest. If you can prove that a validator verified a fake PoRep,
then the validators stake can be slashed.</p>
<p>Replicators are specialized <em>light clients</em>. They download a part of the ledger
and store it, and provide PoReps of storing the ledger. For each verified PoRep
replicators earn a reward of sol from the mining pool.</p>
<a class="header" href="#constraints" id="constraints"><h2>Constraints</h2></a>
<p>We have the following constraints:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verification requires generating the CBC blocks. That requires space of 2
blocks per identity, and 1 CUDA core per identity for the same dataset. So as
many identities at once should be batched with as many proofs for those
identities verified concurrently for the same dataset.</li>
<li>Validators will randomly sample the set of storage proofs to the set that
they can handle, and only the creators of those chosen proofs will be
rewarded. The validator can run a benchmark whenever its hardware configuration
changes to determine what rate it can validate storage proofs.</li>

<ol>
<li>Validator joins the network and submits a storage validation capacity
transaction which tells the network how many proofs it can process in a given
period defined by NUM_KEY_ROTATION_TICKS.</li>
<li>Every NUM_KEY_ROTATION_TICKS the validator stores the PoH value at that
height.</li>
<li>Every NUM_KEY_ROTATION_TICKS it also validates samples received from
replicators. It signs the PoH hash at that point and uses the following
algorithm with the signature as the input:
<ul>
<li>The low 5 bits of the first byte of the signature creates an index into
another starting byte of the signature.</li>
<li>The validator then looks at the set of storage proofs where the byte of
the proof's sha state vector starting from the low byte matches exactly
with the chosen byte(s) of the signature.</li>
<li>If the set of proofs is larger than the validator can handle, then it
increases to matching 2 bytes in the signature.</li>
<li>Validator continues to increase the number of matching bytes until a
workable set is found.</li>
<li>It then creates a mask of valid proofs and fake proofs and sends it to
the leader. This is a storage proof confirmation transaction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The storage proof confirmation transaction is integrated into the ledger.</li>
<li>After a lockout period of NUM_SECONDS_STORAGE_LOCKOUT seconds, the
validator then submits a storage proof claim transaction which then causes the

value is and its entry_height.</li>
</ol>
<a class="header" href="#replicator-behavior" id="replicator-behavior"><h3>Replicator behavior</h3></a>
<ol>
<li>Since a replicator is somewhat of a light client and not downloading all the
ledger data, they have to rely on other full nodes (validators) for
information. Any given validator may or may not be malicious and give incorrect
information, although there are not any obvious attack vectors that this could
accomplish besides having the replicator do extra wasted work.  For many of the
operations there are number of options depending on how paranoid a replicator
is:
<ul>
<li>(a) replicator can ask a validator</li>
<li>(b) replicator can ask multiple validators</li>
<li>(c) replicator can subscribe to the full transaction stream and generate
the information itself</li>
<li>(d) replicator can subscribe to an abbreviated transaction stream to
generate the information itself</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A replicator obtains the PoH hash corresponding to the last key rotation
along with its entry_height.</li>
<li>The replicator signs the PoH hash with its keypair. That signature is the
seed used to pick the segment to replicate and also the encryption key. The
replicator mods the signature with the entry_height to get which segment to
replicate.</li>
<li>The replicator retrives the ledger by asking peer validators and
replicators. See 6.5.</li>
<li>The replicator then encrypts that segment with the key with chacha algorithm
in CBC mode with NUM_CHACHA_ROUNDS of encryption.</li>
<li>The replicator initializes a chacha rng with the signature from step 2 as
the seed.</li>
<li>The replicator generates NUM_STORAGE_SAMPLES samples in the range of the
entry size and samples the encrypted segment with sha256 for 32-bytes at each
offset value. Sampling the state should be faster than generating the encrypted
segment.</li>
<li>The replicator sends a PoRep proof transaction which contains its sha state
at the end of the sampling operation, its seed and the samples it used to the
current leader and it is put onto the ledger.</li>
<li>The replicator then generates another set of offsets which it submits a fake
proof with an incorrect sha state. It can be proven to be fake by providing the
seed for the hash result.
<ul>
<li>A fake proof should consist of a replicator hash of a signature of a PoH
value. That way when the replicator reveals the fake proof, it can be
verified on chain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The replicator monitors the ledger, if it sees a fake proof integrated, it
creates a challenge transaction and submits it to the current leader. The
transacation proves the validator incorrectly validated a fake storage proof.
The replicator is rewarded and the validator's staking balance is slashed or
frozen.</li>

<ol>
<li>Validators monitor the transaction stream for storage mining proofs, and
keep a mapping of ledger segments by entry_height to public keys. When it sees
a storage mining proof it updates this mapping and provides an RPC interface
which takes an entry_height and hands back a list of public keys.  The client
then looks up in their cluster_info table to see which network address that
corresponds to and sends a repair request to retrieve the necessary blocks of
ledger.</li>
<li>Validators would need to prune this list which it could do by periodically
looking at the oldest entries in its mappings and doing a network query to see
if the storage host is still serving the first entry.</li>
</ol>
<a class="header" href="#sybil-attacks" id="sybil-attacks"><h2>Sybil attacks</h2></a>
<p>For any random seed, we force everyone to use a signature that is derived from
a PoH hash. Everyone must use the same count, so the same PoH hash is signed by
every participant. The signatures are then each cryptographically tied to the
keypair, which prevents a leader from grinding on the resulting value for more
than 1 identity.</p>
<p>Since there are many more client identities then encryption identities, we need
to split the reward for multiple clients, and prevent Sybil attacks from
generating many clients to acquire the same block of data. To remain BFT we
want to avoid a single human entity from storing all the replications of a
single chunk of the ledger.</p>
<p>Our solution to this is to force the clients to continue using the same
identity. If the first round is used to acquire the same block for many client
identities, the second round for the same client identities will force a
redistribution of the signatures, and therefore PoRep identities and blocks.
Thus to get a reward for replicators need to store the first block for free and
the network can reward long lived client identities more than new ones.</p>
<a class="header" href="#validator-attacks" id="validator-attacks"><h2>Validator attacks</h2></a>
<ul>
<li>If a validator approves fake proofs, replicator can easily out them by
showing the initial state for the hash.</li>
<li>If a validator marks real proofs as fake, no on-chain computation can be done
to distinguish who is correct. Rewards would have to rely on the results from
multiple validators in a stake-weighted fashion to catch bad actors and
replicators from being locked out of the network.</li>
<li>Validator stealing mining proof results for itself. The proofs are derived
from a signature from a replicator, since the validator does not know the
private key used to generate the encryption key, it cannot be the generator of
the proof.</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#reward-incentives" id="reward-incentives"><h2>Reward incentives</h2></a>
<p>Fake proofs are easy to generate but difficult to verify. For this reason,
PoRep proof transactions generated by replicators may require a higher fee than
a normal transaction to represent the computational cost required by
validators.</p>
<p>Some percentage of fake proofs are also necessary to receive a reward from
storage mining.</p>
<a class="header" href="#notes-1" id="notes-1"><h2>Notes</h2></a>
<ul>
<li>We can reduce the costs of verification of PoRep by using PoH, and actually
make it feasible to verify a large number of proofs for a global dataset.</li>
<li>We can eliminate grinding by forcing everyone to sign the same PoH hash and
use the signatures as the seed</li>
<li>The game between validators and replicators is over random blocks and random
encryption identities and random data samples. The goal of randomization is
to prevent colluding groups from having overlap on data or validation.</li>
<li>Replicator clients fish for lazy validators by submitting fake proofs that
they can prove are fake.</li>
<li>To defend against Sybil client identities that try to store the same block we
force the clients to store for multiple rounds before receiving a reward.</li>
<li>Validators should also get rewarded for validating submitted storage proofs
as incentive for storing the ledger. They can only validate proofs if they
are storing that slice of the ledger.</li>

<a class="header" href="#signing-using-secure-enclave" id="signing-using-secure-enclave"><h1>Signing using Secure Enclave</h1></a>
<p>This document defines the security mechanism of signing keys used by the
fullnodes. Every node contains an asymmetric key that's used for signing
and verifying the votes. The node signs the vote transactions using its private
key. Other entities can verify the signature using the node's public key.</p>
<p>The node's stake or its resources could be compromised if its private key is
used to sign incorrect data (e.g. voting on multiple forks of the ledger). So,
it's important to safeguard the private key.</p>
<p>Secure Enclaves (such as SGX) provide a layer of memory and computation
protection. An enclave can be used to generate an asymmetric key and keep the
private key in its protected memory. It can expose an API that user (untrusted)
code can use for signing the transactions.</p>
<a class="header" href="#message-flow-1" id="message-flow-1"><h2>Message Flow</h2></a>
<ol>
<li>The node initializes the enclave at startup
<ul>
<li>The enclave generates an asymmetric key and returns the public key to the

<li>The keypair is ephemeral. A new keypair is generated on node bootup. A
new keypair might also be generated at runtime based on some TBD
criteria.</li>
<li>The enclave returns its attestation report to the node</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The node performs attestation of the enclave (e.g using Intel's IAS APIs)

</ul>
</li>
<li>The owner of the node grants ephemeral key permission to use its stake. This

<li>The node's untrusted, non-enclave software calls trusted enclave software

<a class="header" href="#poh-verification" id="poh-verification"><h2>PoH Verification</h2></a>

<li>When the node votes on an en entry <code>X</code>, there's a lockout period <code>N</code>, for
which it cannot vote on a fork that does not contain <code>X</code> in its history.</li>
<li>Every time the node votes on the derivative of <code>X</code>, say <code>X+y</code>, the lockout
period for <code>X</code> increases by a factor <code>F</code> (i.e. the duration node cannot vote on

<ul>
<li>The lockout period for <code>X+y</code> is still <code>N</code> until the node votes again.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The lockout period increment is capped (e.g. factor <code>F</code> applies maximum 32
times).</li>
<li>The signing enclave must not sign a vote that violates this policy. This

<li>Enclave is initialized with <code>N</code>, <code>F</code> and <code>Factor cap</code></li>
<li>Enclave stores <code>Factor cap</code> number of entry IDs on which the node had

<a class="header" href="#ancestor-verification" id="ancestor-verification"><h2>Ancestor Verification</h2></a>
<p>This is alternate, albeit, less certain approach to verifying voting fork.</p>
<ol>
<li>The validator maintains an active set of nodes in the cluster</li>
<li>It observes the votes from the active set in the last voting period</li>
<li>It stores the ancestor/last_tick at which each node voted</li>

<ul>
<li>It signs the new vote if the check is successful</li>
<li>It asserts (raises an alarm of some sort) if the check is unsuccessful</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The premise is that the validator can be spoofed at most once to vote on
incorrect data. If someone hijacks the validator and submits a vote request for
bogus data, that vote will not be included in the PoH (as it'll be rejected by
the cluster). The next time the validator sends a request to sign the vote, the
signing service will detect that validator's last vote is missing (as part of
#5 above).</p>
<a class="header" href="#fork-determination" id="fork-determination"><h2>Fork determination</h2></a>
<p>Due to the fact that the enclave cannot process PoH, it has no direct knowledge
of fork history of a submitted validator vote. Each enclave should be initiated
with the current <em>active set</em> of public keys. A validator should submit its
current vote along with the votes of the active set (including itself) that it
observed in the slot of its previous vote. In this way, the enclave can surmise
the votes accompanying the validator's previous vote and thus the fork being
voted on. This is not possible for the validator's initial submitted vote, as
it will not have a 'previous' slot to reference. To account for this, a short
voting freeze should apply until the second vote is submitted containing the
votes within the active set, along with it's own vote, at the height of the
initial vote.</p>
<a class="header" href="#enclave-configuration" id="enclave-configuration"><h2>Enclave configuration</h2></a>
<p>A staking client should be configurable to prevent voting on inactive forks.
This mechanism should use the client's known active set <code>N_active</code> along with a
threshold vote <code>N_vote</code> and a threshold depth <code>N_depth</code> to determine whether or
not to continue voting on a submitted fork. This configuration should take the
form of a rule such that the client will only vote on a fork if it observes
more than <code>N_vote</code> at <code>N_depth</code>. Practically, this represents the client from
confirming that it has observed some probability of economic finality of the
submitted fork at a depth where an additional vote would create a lockout for
an undesirable amount of time if that fork turns out not to be live.</p>
<a class="header" href="#signing-service-1" id="signing-service-1"><h2>Signing service</h2></a>
<p>The signing service consists of a a JSON RPC server, and a request processor.
At startup, it starts the RPC server at a configured port and waits for
client/validator requests. It expects the following type of requests.</p>
<ol>
<li>Register a new validator node
<ul>
<li>The request contains validator's identity (public key)</li>
<li>The request is signed with validator's private key</li>
<li>The service will drop the request if signature of the request cannot be
verified</li>
<li>The service will create a new voting asymmetric key for the validator,
and return the public key as a response</li>
<li>If a validator retries to register, it'll return the public key from the
pre-existing keypair</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sign a vote
<ul>
<li>The request contains voting transaction, and all verification data (as
described in Ancestor Verification)</li>
<li>The request is signed with validator's private key</li>
<li>The service will drop the request if signature of the request cannot be
verified</li>
<li>The service will verify the voting data</li>
<li>The service will return a signed transaction (or signature for the
transaction)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The service could potentially have different variations, depending on the
hardware platform capabilities. For example, if the hardware supports a secure
enclave, the service can offload asymmetric key generation, and private key
protection to the enclave. A less secure implementation of the service could
simply carry the keypair in the process memory.</p>
<a class="header" href="#validator-voting" id="validator-voting"><h2>Validator voting</h2></a>
<p>A validator node, at startup, creates a new vote account and registers it with

<p>Initial Proof of Stake (PoS) (i.e. using in-protocol asset, SOL, to provide
secure consensus) design ideas outlined here. Solana will implement a proof of
stake reward/security scheme for node validators in the cluster. The purpose is
threefold:</p>
<ul>
<li>Align validator incentives with that of the greater cluster through
skin-in-the-game deposits at risk</li>
<li>Avoid 'nothing at stake' fork voting issues by implementing slashing rules
aimed at promoting fork convergence</li>
<li>Provide an avenue for validator rewards provided as a function of validator
participation in the cluster.</li>
</ul>
<p>While many of the details of the specific implementation are currently under
consideration and are expected to come into focus through specific modeling
studies and parameter exploration on the Solana testnet, we outline here our
current thinking on the main components of the PoS system. Much of this
thinking is based on the current status of Casper FFG, with optimizations and
specific attributes to be modified as is allowed by Solana's Proof of History
(PoH) blockchain data structure.</p>
<a class="header" href="#general-overview" id="general-overview"><h3>General Overview</h3></a>
<p>Solana's ledger validation design is based on a rotating, stake-weighted
randomly selected leader broadcasting transactions in a PoH data
structure to validating nodes. These nodes, upon receiving the leader's
broadcast, have the opportunity to vote on the current state and PoH height by
signing a transaction into the PoH stream.</p>
<p>To become a Solana validator, a fullnode must deposit/lock-up some amount
of SOL in a contract. This SOL will not be accessible for a specific time
period. The precise duration of the staking lockup period has not been
determined. However we can consider three phases of this time for which
specific parameters will be necessary:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Warm-up period</em>: which SOL is deposited and inaccessible to the node,
however PoH transaction validation has not begun. Most likely on the order of
days to weeks</li>
<li><em>Validation period</em>: a minimum duration for which the deposited SOL will be
inaccessible, at risk of slashing (see slashing rules below) and earning
rewards for the validator participation. Likely duration of months to a
year.</li>
<li><em>Cool-down period</em>: a duration of time following the submission of a
'withdrawal' transaction. During this period validation responsibilities have
been removed and the funds continue to be inaccessible. Accumulated rewards
should be delivered at the end of this period, along with the return of the
initial deposit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Solana's trustless sense of time and ordering provided by its PoH data
structure, along with its
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt_gDRXHrHQ&amp;t=1s">avalanche</a> data broadcast
and transmission design, should provide subsecond confirmation times that scale
with the log of the number of nodes in the cluster. This means we shouldn't
have to restrict the number of validating nodes with a prohibitive 'minimum
deposits' and expect nodes to be able to become validators with nominal amounts
of SOL staked. This should also render validation pools, a proposed solution
for economic censorship imposed by minimum staking amounts currently described
in Casper, unnecessary and remove the concern for needing to put slashable
stake at risk while relying on others to play by the rules.</p>
<a class="header" href="#stake-weighted-rewards" id="stake-weighted-rewards"><h3>Stake-weighted Rewards</h3></a>
<p>Rewards are expected to be paid out to active validators as a function of
validator activity and as a proportion of the percentage of SOL they have at
stake out of the entirety of the staking pool.</p>
<p>We expect to define a baseline annual validator payout/inflation rate based on
the total SOL deposited. E.g. 10% annual interest on SOL deposited with X total
SOL deposited as slashable on the cluster. This is the same design as currently
proposed in Casper FFG which has additionally specifies how inflation rates
adjust as a function of total ETH deposited. Specifically, Casper validator
returns are proportional to the inverse square root of the total deposits and
initial annual rates are estimated as:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="right"> Deposit Size </th><th align="right"> Annual Validator Interest </th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="right"> 2.5M ETH     </td><td align="right"> 10.12%                    </td></tr>

<p>This has the nice property of potentially incentivizing participation around a
target deposit size. Incentivisation of specific participation rates more
directly (rather than deposit size) may something also worth exploring.</p>
<p>The specifics of the Solana validator reward scheme are to be worked out in
parallel with a design for transaction fee assignment as well as our storage
mining reward scheme.</p>
<a class="header" href="#slashing-rules" id="slashing-rules"><h3>Slashing rules</h3></a>
<p>Unlike Proof of Work (PoW) where off-chain capital expenses are already
deployed at the time of block construction/voting, PoS systems require
capital-at-risk to prevent a logical/optimal strategy of multiple chain voting.
We intend to implement slashing rules which, if broken, result some amount of
the offending validator's deposited stake to be removed from circulation. Given
the ordering properties of the PoH data structure, we believe we can simplify
our slashing rules to the level of a voting lockout time assigned per vote.</p>
<p>I.e. Each vote has an associated lockout time (PoH duration) that represents a
duration by any additional vote from that validator must be in a PoH that
contains the original vote, or a portion of that validator's stake is
slashable. This duration time is a function of the initial vote PoH count and
all additional vote PoH counts.  It will likely take the form:</p>
<p>Lockout<sub>i</sub>(PoH<sub>i</sub>, PoH<sub>j</sub>) = PoH<sub>j</sub> + K *
exp((PoH<sub>j</sub> - PoH<sub>i</sub>) / K)</p>
<p>Where PoH<sub>i</sub> is the height of the vote that the lockout is to be
applied to and PoH<sub>j</sub> is the height of the current vote on the same
fork. If the validator submits a vote on a different PoH fork on any
PoH<sub>k</sub> where k &gt; j &gt; i and PoH<sub>k</sub> &lt; Lockout(PoH<sub>i</sub>,
PoH<sub>j</sub>), then a portion of that validator's stake is at risk of being
slashed.</p>
<p>In addition to the functional form lockout described above, early
implementation may be a numerical approximation based on a First In, First Out
(FIFO) data structure and the following logic:</p>
<ul>
<li>FIFO queue holding 32 votes per active validator</li>
<li>new votes are pushed on top of queue (<code>push_front</code>)</li>
<li>expired votes are popped off top (<code>pop_front</code>)</li>
<li>as votes are pushed into the queue, the lockout of each queued vote doubles</li>
<li>votes are removed from back of queue if <code>queue.len() &gt; 32</code></li>
<li>the earliest and latest height that has been removed from the back of the
queue should be stored</li>
</ul>
<p>It is likely that a reward will be offered as a % of the slashed amount to any
node that submits proof of this slashing condition being violated to the PoH.</p>
<a class="header" href="#partial-slashing" id="partial-slashing"><h4>Partial Slashing</h4></a>
<p>In the schema described so far, when a validator votes on a given PoH stream,
they are committing themselves to that fork for a time determined by the vote
lockout. An open question is whether validators will be hesitant to begin
voting on an available fork if the penalties are perceived too harsh for an
honest mistake or flipped bit.</p>
<p>One way to address this concern would be a partial slashing design that results
in a slashable amount as a function of either:</p>
<ol>
<li>the fraction of validators, out of the total validator pool, that were also
slashed during the same time period (ala Casper)</li>
<li>the amount of time since the vote was cast (e.g. a linearly increasing % of
total deposited as slashable amount over time), or both.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is an area currently under exploration</p>
<a class="header" href="#penalties" id="penalties"><h3>Penalties</h3></a>
<p>As previously discussed, annual validator reward rates are to be specified as a
function of total amount staked. The cluster rewards validators who are online
and actively participating in the validation process throughout the entirety of
their <em>validation period</em>. For validators that go offline/fail to validate
transactions during this period, their annual reward is effectively reduced.</p>
<p>Similarly, we may consider an algorithmic reduction in a validator's active
amount staked amount in the case that they are offline. I.e. if a validator is
inactive for some amount of time, either due to a partition or otherwise, the
amount of their stake that is considered ‘active’ (eligible to earn rewards)
may be reduced. This design would be structured to help long-lived partitions
to eventually reach finality on their respective chains as the % of non-voting
total stake is reduced over time until a super-majority can be achieved by the
active validators in each partition. Similarly, upon re-engaging, the ‘active’
amount staked will come back online at some defined rate. Different rates of
stake reduction may be considered depending on the size of the partition/active
set.</p>
<a class="header" href="#fork-selection" id="fork-selection"><h1>Fork Selection</h1></a>
<p>This article describes Solana's <em>Nakomoto Fork Selection</em> algorithm based on time
locks. It satisfies the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>A voter can eventually recover from voting on a fork that doesn't become the
fork with the desired network finality.</li>
<li>If the voters share a common ancestor then they will converge to a fork
containing that ancestor no matter how they are partitioned. The converged
ancestor may not be the latest possible ancestor at the start of the fork.</li>
<li>Rollback requires exponentially more time for older votes than for newer
votes.</li>
<li>Voters have the freedom to set a minimum network confirmation threshold
before committing a vote to a higher lockout.  This allows each voter to make
a trade-off between risk and reward. See <a href="#cost-of-rollback">cost of rollback</a>.</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#time" id="time"><h2>Time</h2></a>
<p>For networks like Solana, time can be the PoH hash count, which is a VDF that
provides a source of time before consensus. Other networks adopting this
approach would need to consider a global source of time.</p>
<p>For Solana, time uniquely identifies a specific leader for fork generation.  At
any given time only 1 leader, which can be computed from the ledger itself, can
propose a fork.  For more details, see <a href="fork-generation.html">fork generation</a>
and <a href="leader-rotation.html">leader rotation</a>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#algorithm" id="algorithm"><h2>Algorithm</h2></a>
<p>The basic idea to this approach is to stack consensus votes.  Each vote in the
stack is a confirmation of a fork.  Each confirmed fork is an ancestor of the
fork above it.  Each consensus vote has a <code>lockout</code> in units of time before the
validator can submit a vote that does not contain the confirmed fork as an
ancestor.</p>
<p>When a vote is added to the stack, the lockouts of all the previous votes in
the stack are doubled (more on this in <a href="#Rollback">Rollback</a>).  With each new
vote, a voter commits the previous votes to an ever-increasing lockout.  At 32
votes we can consider the vote to be at <code>max lockout</code> any votes with a lockout
equal to or above <code>1&lt;&lt;32</code> are dequeued (FIFO).  Dequeuing a vote is the trigger
for a reward.  If a vote expires before it is dequeued, it and all the votes
above it are popped (LIFO) from the vote stack.  The voter needs to start
rebuilding the stack from that point.</p>
<a class="header" href="#rollback" id="rollback"><h3>Rollback</h3></a>
<p>Before a vote is pushed to the stack, all the votes leading up to vote with a
lower lock time than the new vote are popped.  After rollback lockouts are not
doubled until the voter catches up to the rollback height of votes.</p>
<p>For example, a vote stack with the following state:</p>

<p>The lockout for vote 1 will not increase from 16 until the stack contains 5
votes.</p>
<a class="header" href="#slashing-and-rewards" id="slashing-and-rewards"><h3>Slashing and Rewards</h3></a>
<p>The purpose of the lockout is to force a voter to commit opportunity cost to a
specific fork.  Voters that violate the lockouts and vote for a diverging fork
within the lockout should be punished.  Slashing or simply freezing the voter
from rewards for a long period of time can be used as punishment.</p>
<p>Voters should be rewarded for selecting the fork that the rest of the network
selected as often as possible.  This is well-aligned with generating a reward
when the vote stack is full and the oldest vote needs to be dequeued.  Thus a
reward should be generated for each successful dequeue.</p>
<a class="header" href="#cost-of-rollback" id="cost-of-rollback"><h3>Cost of Rollback</h3></a>
<p>Cost of rollback of <em>fork A</em> is defined as the cost in terms of lockout time to
the validators to confirm any other fork that does not include <em>fork A</em> as an
ancestor.</p>
<p>The <strong>Economic Finality</strong> of <em>fork A</em> can be calculated as the loss of all the
rewards from rollback of <em>fork A</em> and its descendants, plus the opportunity
cost of reward due to the exponentially growing lockout of the votes that have
confirmed <em>fork A</em>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#thresholds" id="thresholds"><h3>Thresholds</h3></a>
<p>Each voter can independently set a threshold of network commitment to a fork
before that voter commits to a fork.  For example, at vote stack index 7, the
lockout is 256 time units.  A voter may withhold votes and let votes 0-7 expire
unless the vote at index 7 has at greater than 50% commitment in the network.
This allows each voter to independently control how much risk to commit to a
fork.  Committing to forks at a higher frequency would allow the voter to earn
more rewards.</p>
<a class="header" href="#algorithm-parameters" id="algorithm-parameters"><h3>Algorithm parameters</h3></a>
<p>These parameters need to be tuned.</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of votes in the stack before dequeue occurs (32).</li>
<li>Rate of growth for lockouts in the stack (2x).</li>
<li>Starting default lockout (2).</li>
<li>Threshold depth for minimum network commitment before committing to the fork
(8).</li>
<li>Minimum network commitment size at threshold depth (50%+).</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#free-choice" id="free-choice"><h3>Free Choice</h3></a>
<p>A &quot;Free Choice&quot; is an unenforcible voter action.  A voter that maximizes
self-reward over all possible futures should behave in such a way that the
system is stable, and the local greedy choice should result in a greedy choice
over all possible futures.  A set of voter that are engaging in choices to
disrupt the protocol should be bound by their stake weight to the denial of
service.  Two options exits for voter:</p>
<ul>
<li>a voter can outrun previous voters in virtual generation and submit a
concurrent fork</li>
<li>a voter can withhold a vote to observe multiple forks before voting</li>
</ul>
<p>In both cases, the voters in the network have several forks to pick from
concurrently, even though each fork represents a different height.  In both
cases it is impossible for the protocol to detect if the voter behavior is
intentional or not.</p>
<a class="header" href="#greedy-choice-for-concurrent-forks" id="greedy-choice-for-concurrent-forks"><h3>Greedy Choice for Concurrent Forks</h3></a>
<p>When evaluating multiple forks, each voter should pick the fork that will
maximize economic finality for the network, or the latest fork if all are equal.</p>

<p>This document proposes a change to ledger and window to support Solana's <a href="fork-generation.html">fork
generation</a> behavior.</p>
<a class="header" href="#current-design" id="current-design"><h2>Current Design</h2></a>
<a class="header" href="#functionality-of-window-and-ledger" id="functionality-of-window-and-ledger"><h3>Functionality of Window And Ledger</h3></a>
<p>The basic responsibilities of the window and the ledger in a Solana fullnode
are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Window: serve as a temporary, RAM-backed store of blobs of the PoH chain
for re-ordering and assembly into contiguous blocks to be sent to the bank
for verification.</li>
<li>Window: serve as a RAM-backed repair facility for other validator nodes,
which may query the network for as-yet unreceived blobs.</li>
<li>Ledger: provide disk-based storage of the PoH chain in case of node
restart.</li>
<li>Ledger: provide disk-backed repair facility for when the (smaller)
RAM-backed window doesn't cover the repair request.</li>
</ol>
<p>The window is at the front of a validator node's processing pipeline, blobs are
received, cached, re-ordered before being deserialized into Entries, passed to
the bank for verification, and finally on to the ledger, which is at the back
of a validator node's pipeline.</p>
<p>The window holds blobs (the over-the-air format, serialized Entries,
one-per-blob).  The ledger holds serialized Entries without any blob
information.</p>
<a class="header" href="#limitations" id="limitations"><h3>Limitations</h3></a>
<a class="header" href="#one-dimensional-key-space" id="one-dimensional-key-space"><h4>One-dimensional key space</h4></a>
<p>The window and the ledger are indexed by ledger height, which is number of
Entries ever generated in the PoH chain until the current blob.  This
limitation prevents the window and the ledger from storing the overlapping
histories possible in Solana's consensus protocol.</p>
<a class="header" href="#limited-caching" id="limited-caching"><h4>Limited caching</h4></a>
<p>The window is a circular buffer.  It cannot accept blobs that are farther in
the future than the window is currently working.  If a blob arrives that is too
far ahead, it is dropped and will subsequently need to be repaired, incurring
further delay for the node.</p>
<a class="header" href="#loss-of-blob-signatures" id="loss-of-blob-signatures"><h4>Loss of blob signatures</h4></a>
<p>Because the blob signatures are stripped before being stored by the ledger,
repair requests served from the ledger can't be verified to the original
leader.</p>
<a class="header" href="#rollback-and-checkpoint-switching-forks-separate-functions" id="rollback-and-checkpoint-switching-forks-separate-functions"><h4>Rollback and checkpoint, switching forks, separate functions</h4></a>
<p>The window and the ledger can't handle replay of alternate forks.  Once a Blob
has passed through the window, it's in the past.  The replay stage of a
validator will need to roll back to a previous checkpoint and decode an
alternate set of Blobs to the Bank.  The separated and one-way nature of window
and ledger makes this hard.</p>
<a class="header" href="#new-design" id="new-design"><h2>New Design</h2></a>
<p>A unified window and ledger allows a validator to record every blob it observes
on the network, in any order, as long as the blob is consistent with the
network's leader schedule.</p>
<p>Blobs are moved to a fork-able key space the tuple of <code>leader slot</code> + <code>blob index</code> (within the slot).  This permits the skip-list structure of the Solana
protocol to be stored in its entirety, without a-priori choosing which fork to
follow, which Entries to persist or when to persist them.</p>
<p>Repair requests for recent blobs are served out of RAM or recent files and out
of deeper storage for less recent blobs, as implemented by the store backing
EntryTree.</p>
<a class="header" href="#functionalities-of-entrytree" id="functionalities-of-entrytree"><h3>Functionalities of EntryTree</h3></a>
<ol>
<li>Persistence: the EntryTree lives in the front of the nodes verification
pipeline, right behind network receive and signature verification.  If the
blob received is consistent with the leader schedule (i.e. was signed by the
leader for the indicated slot), it is immediately stored.</li>
<li>Repair: repair is the same as window repair above, but able to serve any
blob that's been received. EntryTree stores blobs with signatures,
preserving the chain of origination.</li>
<li>Forks: EntryTree supports random access of blobs, so can support a
validator's need to rollback and replay from a Bank checkpoint.</li>
<li>Restart: with proper pruning/culling, the EntryTree can be replayed by
ordered enumeration of entries from slot 0.  The logic of the replay stage
(i.e. dealing with forks) will have to be used for the most recent entries in
the EntryTree.</li>
</ol>
<a class="header" href="#interfacing-with-bank" id="interfacing-with-bank"><h3>Interfacing with Bank</h3></a>
<p>The bank exposes to replay stage:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>prev_id: which PoH chain it's working on as indicated by the id of the last
entry it processed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>tick_height: the ticks in the PoH chain currently being verified by this
bank</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>votes: a stack of records that contain</p>
<ol>
<li>prev_ids: what anything after this vote must chain to in PoH</li>
<li>tick height: the tick_height at which this vote was cast</li>
<li>lockout period: how long a chain must be observed to be in the ledger to
be able to be chained below this vote</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Replay stage uses EntryTree APIs to find the longest chain of entries it can
hang off a previous vote.  If that chain of entries does not hang off the
latest vote, the replay stage rolls back the bank to that vote and replays the
chain from there.</p>
<a class="header" href="#pruning-entrytree" id="pruning-entrytree"><h3>Pruning EntryTree</h3></a>
<p>Once EntryTree entries are old enough, representing all the possible forks
becomes less useful, perhaps even problematic for replay upon restart.  Once a
validator's votes have reached max lockout, however, any EntryTree contents
that are not on the PoH chain for that vote for can be pruned, expunged.</p>
<p>Replicator nodes will be responsible for storing really old ledger contents,
and validators need only persist their bank periodically.</p>
